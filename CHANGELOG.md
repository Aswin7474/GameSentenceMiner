### 1.9.0

Finally added something I wanted to add a while ago, was a bit simpler than i expected.
Ability to open the Anki Audio in an external tool (I highly recommend [ocenaudio](https://www.ocenaudio.com/)) to trim the audio after flash card creation. If you use ocenaudio, and have the path set to anki, you can edit the audio **in place** and the audio in the anki card will automatically be updated. 

I will likely record a video so this becomes more clear, but in the meantime hopefully these screenshots explain it better.

The screenshots are Original Audio -> Select Portion -> Trim (Alt + T) -> Save (Ctrl + S). And now the audio is perfectly trimmed in my anki card. I also included both original and trimmed audio.
